	1.NetStumbler

NetStumbler (also known as Network Stumbler) is a tool for Windows that facilitates detection of Wireless LANs using the 802.11b, 802.11a and 802.11g WLAN standards. A trimmed-down version called MiniStumbler is available for the handheld Windows CE operating system. 

2.InSSIDer 

inSSIDer is a Wi-Fi network scanner application for Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X developed by MetaGeek, LLC. inSSIDer began as a replacement for NetStumbler primarily because the latter does not work with modern 64-bit operating systems or versions of Windows higher than Windows XP. 

3.Vistumbler 

Uses the Vista command 'netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid' to get wireless information and supports Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8.
